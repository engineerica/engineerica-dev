DESCRIPTION
-----------

This repository contains 2 separated main projects, a code generator that provides updates to the APIs and the API by themselves that you can use to connect to AccuClass, Conference Tracker and/or AccuWB.

If you want to use the client, just download the latest release from Google Code and include it in your project.

If you want to update the API to include the latest changes in the server, you can read below.  The code generator is built in Node.js.


REQUIREMENTS FOR UPDATING THE API
---------------------------------

You will have to do this only if you want to update the API to have the latest things available on the server.  You can also email us and we will update the release in case we didn't do that yet.

You need to install Node.js and optionally NPM to install additional packages, please refer to the documentation in these websites:
- http://nodejs.org/
- https://npmjs.org/
