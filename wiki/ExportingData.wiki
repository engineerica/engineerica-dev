#summary This shows how to export data from one of our systems.

= Exporting Data =

Currently you can only export data from either `AccuClass` or Conference-Tracker.  AccuWB does not support exporting or importing data.

To do so, you first need to connect to the server, for example executing the following code:

{{{
var loginRes = EngineericaApi.AccuClass.Login.Execute(domain, email, password, "token");
}}}

For more information, please see ConnectingToAnApplication

Then, you can create a job requesting the data to be exported, as follows:

{{{
// Request the data to be exported
var exp = EngineericaApi.AccuClass.Export.Execute(EngineericaApi.AccuClass.ExportType.Students, "XLS");
}}}

Once the request was issued, you can monitor the job until it's completed.  It's recommended to check every a couple seconds to avoid overloading the server.

{{{
var jobId = new Guid(exp.Response.JobId.ToString());
do {
	System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(5000);

	// Get the job status
	var res = EngineericaApi.AccuClass.Bgjob.Getstatus(jobId, null);

	// Check it's completed
	if (res.Response.results[0].Succeed.Value) break;
} while(true);
}}}

Once we confirmed the job was executed successfully, you can download the file that will be hosted in either www.accuclass.net or www.conftrac.com, under the path `/JobResults/` with a name matching the job id and the extension _.html_, _.csv_ or _.xlsx_.

For example, if you want to open that file, you can do the following:

{{{
// Once it's ready, you can open the file, download it or do whatever you want.
System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("http://www.accuclass.net/JobResults/" + jobId + ".xlsx");
}}}
