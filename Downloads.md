In order to compile the API, you will need:

1. To regenerate the API files, Node.js installed. Checkout the [Node.JS Site](http://nodejs.org) for installation instructions.

2. To compile it, you will need to have the .NET Framework v4.0 SDK installed. Visual Studio .NET 2010 or MonoDevelop will do the work.
